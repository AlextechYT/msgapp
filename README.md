# msgapp
To run the app, first download the installer, then select the desired file type, select a install directory, and hit install! When it says it installed, go to the folder you selcted, and open client_run.exe.
Note: 2 or more computers must be running the app at the same time on the same LAN as each other for this to work. You may have to make a firewall exeption for it to work. The port is 5555.


Linux support is in development, and will be implemented via WINE. You will need to have SUDO perms and APT on your system for this to work.

Soon, it will communicate with a server I will host myself, so that you don't need the firewall exception/can talk to people all over the world!
Note that .py versions are normally the fastest for updates to be commited to, followed by .exe.
