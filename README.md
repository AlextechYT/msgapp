# msgapp
 Note: This repo is only for a app I made to download and install updates automattically. It doesn't really have any useful code to any other person.
To run the app, first download the installer, then select the desired file type, select a install directory, and hit install! When it says it installed, go to the folder you selcted, and open client_run.exe.
Note: 2 or more computers must be running the app at the same time on the same LAN as each other for this to work. 
I will at some point put the .py version here too.
